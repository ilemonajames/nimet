                                    In the mid-1950s, the National Meteorological Training School was established at Oshodi, Lagos, Nigeria, to train Class IV Meteorologists. The School was part of the then Nigerian Department of Meteorological Services (presently NIMET). 
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    In 1964, a Regional Meteorological Training Centre (RMTC) was established at Ikeja to train Class III and Class II Meteorologists. These two training centres (National Meteorological Training School/and Regional Meteorological Training Centre) were merged in 1975 and designated Meteorological Research and Training Institute (MRTI) at Oshodi, Lagos, Nigeria. In 1994, the Department of Meteorology (now Department of Meteorology and Climate Science) at the Federal University of Technology, Akure was also designated as the University component of the RTC in Nigeria.  The WMO Regional Training Centre (RTC), under the auspices of Nigerian Meteorological Agency (a division under the Directorate of Research and Training, through which it is funded), is responsible for the training of Meteorological, and Climatological Personnel from Nigeria, English-speaking West African countries and other African countries.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    The programmes of training are tailored to the needs of National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHs) in the West African sub-region, Armed Forces, Para-Military, Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) of the Federal Government of Nigeria and the Media.
